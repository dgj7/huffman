# huffman
## Purpose
huffman coding trees, implemented in various languages.

generally treated as a programming challenge, to be redone for any new language learned.

## Todo
1. create a design to be repeated for each program, so that the output from each can be compared and used for unit testing
2. update existing apps to follow the design; add unit tests for both
3. implement in rust, using the new design; add unit tests

## Proposed output for each impl
```
input: <the input string>
    a  001
    b  01
    c  1
encoded: 001011
decoded: <the input string>
``````

## Implementations
* [c++](c++-huffman/)
* [java](java-huffman/)
