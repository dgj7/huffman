## C++
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] don't forget to update `analysis.md`
* [x] ~~incorrect output; probably needs sorting adjustment~~

* [ ] add unit tests

## Rust
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] don't forget to update `analysis.md`

## C
* [ ] implement
* [ ] don't forget to update `analysis.md`
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~ _libhuffman.a is linked to main.c in build.sh_
* [ ] add unit tests; this will involve implementing a build hook to run them and conditionally fail
