# To Do Items
## C
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~ _libhuffman.a is linked to main.c in build.sh_
* [x] ~~setup workflow~~
* [x] ~~update `cmake` version; see build warning~~
* [x] ~~add unit tests~~
  * [x] ~~empty string: ""~~
  * [x] ~~single character "f"~~
  * [x] ~~2 bytes, same~~
  * [x] ~~2 bytes, diff~~
  * [x] ~~short string: "abcaba"~~
  * [x] ~~main case: "this is a sample input string. its text is being used to test the huffman coding tree."~~
* [ ] investigate `free()` for each `malloc()`
* [ ] update build to use valgrind
* [ ] ease of use: combine tree with encodings
* [ ] memory efficiency: implement bit vector for returning data
