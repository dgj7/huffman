# To Do Items
## C++
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~incorrect output; probably needs sorting adjustment~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~ _libhuffman.a is linked to main.cpp in build.sh_
* [x] ~~setup workflow~~
* [ ] update `cmake` version; see build warning
* [ ] add unit tests
* [ ] investigate `delete` for each `new` and `delete[]` for each `new[]`

## Rust
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~
* [x] ~~setup workflow~~
* [ ] add more unit tests

## Go
