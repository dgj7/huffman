# To Do Items
## C
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~ _libhuffman.a is linked to main.c in build.sh_
* [x] ~~setup workflow~~
* [ ] update `cmake` version; see build warning
* [ ] add unit tests
  * [ ] empty string: ""
  * [ ] short string: "abcaba"
  * [x] medium string: "this is a sample input string. its text is being used to test the huffman coding tree."
* [ ] investigate `free()` for each `malloc()`
* [ ] update build to use valgrind
* [ ] ease of use: combine tree with encodings
* [ ] memory efficiency: implement bit vector for returning data
