# To Do Items
## C++
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~incorrect output; probably needs sorting adjustment~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~ _libhuffman.a is linked to main.cpp in build.sh_
* [ ] add unit tests
* [ ] investigate `delete` for each `new` and `delete[]` for each `new[]`

## Rust
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~
* [ ] add more unit tests

## Go
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [ ] externalize huffman functionality as a library
* [ ] add unit tests

## Java
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [ ] externalize huffman functionality as a library
* [ ] add unit tests

## C
* [x] ~~implement~~
* [x] ~~don't forget to update `analysis.md`~~
* [x] ~~externalize huffman functionality as a library~~ _libhuffman.a is linked to main.c in build.sh_
* [ ] add unit tests; this will involve implementing a build hook to run them and conditionally fail
* [ ] investigate `free()` for each `malloc()`

## C#
